# GarmentIQ
**Data-Driven Apparel Operations & Sales Intelligence System**

---

## Project Overview
GarmentIQ (Garment Intelligence Quotient) is a data-driven apparel operations and sales intelligence system designed to transform raw operational data into meaningful business insights.

The system simplifies how apparel businesses manage inventory, track sales, and evaluate performance by providing an easy-to-use web interface for staff and managers to add, update, and maintain operational data. This data is then structured, stored, and analyzed through a business intelligence layer to support smarter, faster, and more accurate decision-making.

GarmentIQ bridges the gap between **operational systems** and **analytics platforms**, allowing businesses to move from manual processes and disconnected tools to a centralized, intelligent decision-support system.
